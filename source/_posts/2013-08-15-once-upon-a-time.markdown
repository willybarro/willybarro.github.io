# Once upon a time...
… there was a guy on his early 20s, he was a software developer who wondered to write on his own blog. He was amazed by how marvelous would his world be if he could express himself, his coding experiences, self-rants, tutorials, puzzles, talk about conferences he attended, about every-day coding challenges and general hackish or nerdish stuff.

His friends told him to write a blog, his old bosses told him to write a blog, even his girlfriend told him to write a blog. And he almost got there in **X** different times, with dozens of completely different themes, in **Y** different CMS's (Wordpress, Jekyll, home baked…) and in **Z** completely different attempts on a couple of years of this new millenium.

You know in all those blogging-attempts what he ~really~ accomplished? **[Absolutely Nothing](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html)!**

And why was that? Why this godamned developer couldn't publish his own blog? Was that a technical problem? Was that a world-class problem? Was every server in the world down?

**Hell no!** It's just his indecisions on selecting a beautiful theme for his own fucking blog. And he's not even a designer, ux designer or average hipster. He's a fucking **developer**!

## Back to reality

Based on our little tale above, let me tell you something:
> Forget about that damn theme and "WRITE, MOTHER FUCKER!" [^1]

If your content is good, nobody will really care if you have a not-so-beautiful theme, and in case you just don't get the hang of blog writing, you would have just spent your time making your blog shine beautifully with no reason at all. So *"WRITE, MOTHER FUCKER!"*.

Leave all those problems to the future. I guarantee that you'll bump on a cool theme in no time or maybe you'll just forget it.

Not convinced yet? Look at any online [language](http://www.php.net/manual/) [documentation](http://www.python.org/doc/). Those documentations doesn't look really sexy, right? If those guys were not following the *"WRITE, MOTHER FUCKER"* line of thought, we would need to scrap infinite sourcefiles just to know what that nasty "[str_pbrk](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strpbrk.php)" function does.

So, stop crying like a baby and "WRITE, MOTHER FUCKER!".

## Finally

I hope this will help someone to get the courage to publish their blogs and stop procrastinating behind that damned wall of "it's not ready yet" or "it's ugly, people won't like it".

## Just a little more...

I've bumped up coincidentally (or not) into a great Octopress theme when I decided to follow my *"WRITE, MOTHER FUCKER!"* not-so *manifesto*. All credits to [Shashank Mehta](http://shashankmehta.in/archive/2012/greyshade.html).
